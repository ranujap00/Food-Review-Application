Create a folder named 'Components' and create all the components inside that folder.
Create a seperate folder named 'CSS' to create all the .css files
If you are using any images, make them in a seperate folder called 'Images/<category>'

Please create a seperate branch when working on a certain feature
    eg: 'create_login' branch when creating login functionality

Pay attention to small details so that we can reduce the merge conflicts which saves up a lot of time.
